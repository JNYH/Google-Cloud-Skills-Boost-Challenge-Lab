# Google-Cloud-Skills-Boost-Challenge-Lab
Collection of Challenge Lab solutions


In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

Topics tested:
* Create an instance
* Create a 3-node Kubernetes cluster and run a simple service
* Create an HTTP(s) load balancer in front of two web servers


This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the Create and Manage Cloud Resources quest.
